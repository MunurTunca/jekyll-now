I am a data geek who loves to explore and unfold insights hiding in data. I have always been fascinated by human nature and numbers for as long as I can remember. Through out my academic and professional career, I realized that data science is the cultivation of these and so much more. Using the vast amounts of data that we are now able to collect and share, I believe that we can have a much better understanding of how we operate.

### Background

I was born in Cyprus and moved to the United States at the age of ten. I hold bachelors' in Psychology, as well as Statistics and Quantitative Modeling. My professional career includes experience in health and marketing fields.
